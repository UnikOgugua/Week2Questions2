Smart Contracts: Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with established rules and circumstances, are used in Web 3.0. These contracts are implemented on blockchain networks, allowing for the automated and trustless execution of agreements, transactions, and inter-party interactions.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Web 3.0 proposes the incorporation of AI and machine learning (ML) technology into different elements of the internet. Intelligent personal assistants, automated decision-making processes, and more sophisticated data analysis are all examples of how to provide personalized and context-aware services.
